Realtime Identification of crop diseases and pests using Machine Learning:-

Development of a software for identifying diseases and pest damage in crops. The software prompts the user to take an image through the camera of their smarphone/import the image to a desktop(or laptop) and it should be able to detect the culprit with the help of Machine Learning model trained using such images. The app should have access to the devices' camera. The model is trained on a dataset of ~2000 images for each disease/pest mentioned and the corresponding disease/pest should be also accompanied by the details about its symptoms, causes and measures to prevent it. The application has algorithms for object detection and image classification. Patter recognition algorithms are developed to provide a close match for all possible inputs.
