Suvrat_Mishra,What is a regex pattern,Thanks for asking Suvrat. Regular expression is widely used in any scripting language. For Python plz refer this: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html
Vivek Kadu, What is TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn are they same or different and which one we will use in our project ??,Thanks for asking Vivek.TensorFlow is the open source ML library now owned by Google. Sci-kit learn is also python based open source library for ML. Both are different libraries use for similar purpose. You can read on Wikipedia about this. Its all depends on your ideas and suggestion to use any particular library. However tensorflow is good to move ahead. Lets see it on 17 Aug as per your ideas.
Suvrat_Mishra,When training the cats and dogs model of kaggle using keras(the training and validation files are reduced to 4000 and 2000 resp.) whenever I start the training i get a warning as Method on_batch_end() is slow compared to the batch update(0.100181) check your callbacks Im using tensorflow backend and doing the preprocessing on image set in real time so how can I optimize my algorithm to properly utilize my resources? GPU utilization sits between 0-5% and VidMem usage is at 3.2 gigs., Try to further minimize/reduce your datasets. Kaggle also has data limitation for free account. For such large data you need to get GPU which comes in paid service. Try Floydhub it offeres GPU for some hours in free access. Check both pricing.
